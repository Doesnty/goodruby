Changes in general are meant to make mons viable at some stage of the game.
Not every mon will be equal, and not every mon will be super good at endgame.
Most should be at least usable there, though.



#001 Bulbasaur, #002 Ivysaur, #003 Venusaur
 // This is one of the best lines for in-game play. The evolution change is just to standardize.
 // It learns Sleep Powder notably later now, but not by too much.
 
#056 Mankey, #057 Primeape
 // Originally I was going to do nothing for these. Mankey's the most obvious crutch for Roxanne.
 // Primeape is largely outclassed but in my testing it was still usable, and it gets good moves fairly early.
 // Playtesters complained the line was too weak, so it got a Speed hike and Stealth Rock.
 // These are to help it fill the holes left by the musketeers, Mienshao, Hawlucha, Infernape, etc.
 // Primeape was already the fastest Fighting mon in the game before the buff, at a modest 95.
 // Now it has a build very similar to Hawlucha's, without being a bird.

#098 Krabby, #099 Kingler
 // I really dislike Liquidation, if for nothing else than that it makes Kingler not use Crabhammer.
 // This is horrible, and as such Crabhammer has been changed to work with Sheer Force.
 // It's also technically a Crawdaunt buff, but the main reason is just so Kingler will be using Crabhammer.

#155 Cyndaquil, #156 Quilava, #157 Typhlosion
 // This is probably one of the weirder mon tweaks.
 // This is admittedly inspired heavily by the Touhoumon 1.8 puppet Yuki, which has a similar build.
 // It's defined by its physical frailty and special offense supplemented by jank physical coverage.
 // I tried to play Typhlosion towards this: Play Rough lets it hit Dragons, Rollout lets it hit other Fires.
 // For Fire offense though, its special options are king between Burn Up, Overheat, and Eruption.
 // ExtremeSpeed is absolutely a stretch, but it is fast.
 // The physical slant also helps Quilava a good bit while it relies on Flame Wheel.

#191 Sunkern, #192 Sunflora
 // I probably would have thrown up at this change a few years ago, heh.
 // Pure Grass Sunflora just has no place in the game.
 // It's hardly stronger than Victreebel, while being way slower and not actually being bulky.
 // Thus, it gets the sunny sunflower overhaul.
 // Drought and STAB Fire typing let it actually nuke things, and have coverage to boot.
 // It's still frail and slow, and the typing isn't as good defensively as you might expect w/o Flash Fire.

#223 Remoraid, #224 Octillery
 // Moody -> Protean.
 // Helps it abuse its crazy coverage and generally be more interesting, hopefully.
 // Unlike its fellow Protean Kecleon it lacks priority, but it makes up for it with more and stronger moves.
 // As for why it has Protean in particular...it's an octopus.

#252 Treecko, #253 Grovyle, #254 Sceptile
 // Treecko is pretty infamous for being the worst Hoenn starter, so the lack of real buffs may seem odd.
 // This is because its level-up movepool is extremely good in mid-game.
 // Fury Cutter, Screech, Detect, and Dual Chop specifically have stealth utility vs nearby bosses.
 // It also gets Leaf Blade extremely early, when the other starters are working with 40 and 60 BP STABs.
 // Because of this, Grovyle is actually quite handy in-game.
 // Sceptile falls off a bit, but it's hardly useless; it's exceptionally fast and can be bred Leech Seed.

#255 Torchic, #256 Combusken, #257 Blaziken
 // I expect a lot of people will be mad at me for taking Speed Boost away from this line.
 // It's not out of spite for it; it's my favorite Hoenn starter line!
 // It's out of concern for how it warps the game; Speed Boost Blaziken is wildly and destructively broken.
 // Even restricting it to late-game isn't an option I like, since it still destroys basically all of late-game.
 // Speed Boost also breaks parity with the other starters, which have extremely trashy HAs.
 // Worst though, I just don't find it as fun to work with as Blaze. Flame Charge into Blaze is really cool.
 // So, it gets Mold Breaker instead, which has a couple uses (mostly against Grumpig) but isn't earth-shattering.

#283 Surskit, #284 Masquerain
 // Bug/Water is a pretty obvious move for it.
 // It's also an anti-flavor move, but Bug/Flying is so diluted that it's completely unreasonable not to do this...

#336 Seviper
 // Merciless on this is one of my favorite changes.
 // It's adapted to Toxic Boost Zangoose. Still slower, but it can put the ability to some use.

#352 Kecleon
 // Kecleon gains Soak and Power Whip.
 // These are actually not meant for the synergy; that's a funny coincidence.
 // It gets Soak to be a conveniently placed aid for the Registeel puzzle.
 // Power Whip is there so it has a strong move to use, and fits given its anatomy.

#353 Shuppet, #354 Banette
 // Banette is now Ghost/Dark.
 // I know a lot of people push for Ghost/Normal on this, but...
 // Go look at its dex entries. It's so malicious.
 // It already has a ton of Dark moves in its natural pool, too.

#357 Tropius
 // Tropius's changes are fairly drastic, but Tropius was in a very painful spot.
 // It joins late, at a point in the game where you probably have a Grass-type.
 // The bosses immediately after it abuse it horribly.
 // Making matters worse, Grass is a competitive type and it can't even learn Sleep Powder.
 // It's really bad when your mon is outclassed hard by Jumpluff for utility.
 // Dragon is a rare type and very reasonable for it, so it gains that and some power.
 // It's quite similar to Appletun now, but with aggressive Abilities and Harvest.

#361 Snorunt, #362 Glalie, #478 Froslass
 // Froslass gains Snow Warning on account of its whole flavor, and no other users of the ability existing.
 // Glalie, sadly, is really hard to work with. Refrigerate is tempting.
 // For now though, it can be the sole Moody abuser, now that Octillery has moved to new waters.

#374 Beldum, #375 Metang, #376 Metagross
 // I know buffing Metagross is kind of insane, but Light Metal does literally nothing for it.
 // It goes from taking 120 BP from weight moves to taking 120 BP. Actually useless in a not funny way.
 // For what it's worth, Steven's Metagross is still Clear Body.
 // I value the Intimidate immunity on the AI more than Iron Fist's extra oomph there.
