MY ELEGANT SYSTEM:

Berries have explicit tiers.
Pokeblocks have three (four) bytes: level, feel, flavor bitfield, (and color).

RESULT:
FLAVOR: Ignore all contributing berries that do not give the highest available flavor mod. Sum results.
 Highest flavors are present, others are absent.

LEVEL: (8 + SumOfFlavors) * speed
FEEL: Set to highest contributing smoothness, minus number of blenders.
